Làm_sao cài_đặt Pro / Engineer ( 1 ) Người_ta nói muốn cài_đặt Pro / Engineer phải có card_mạng , có đúng không ? Nếu đúng , tại_sao như như_vậy ? Hầu_hết các phần_mềm ứng_dụng khác đâu cần như_vậy . Nhờ các anh_chị chỉ_bảo . Thanh_Hai Hồi_âm : Dear_questioner , To use_ProE , a_user must not only have a key which is also called hardware lock that is connected to the paralle port or USB but also must have an_authorization codes that is issued by the vendor . Why does the software maker do it ? Because_the maker wants to protect the software being copied , that is mainly reason why . Does the hardware lock help with preventing from being copied ?_Yes , it does ; however , there is still some TSR programs that have a_capabity to bypass the hardware lock_code and_get ProE loaded as normal . Anyway , the process is not just simple step_and I don't want to expose any further detail because it is not good idea to share this type of_information in public . I hope this will answer your question . Take care .
